# VRCMoreParameters

A Melonloader mod for VRChat that adds additional parameters to your avatars that you can use for animations.

Currently the following parameters are availible:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| HeadX | Float |
| HeadY | Float |
| HeadZ | Float | Head rotations around the Z axis<br />Upright head is 0.5 |

Feel free to suggest ideas for additional paramters, but I can not promise to add anything.
